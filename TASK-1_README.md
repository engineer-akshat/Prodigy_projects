# TASK-1 

PS:-  Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

Sample Dataset :- https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL

# Bar Chart / Histogram: Distribution Visualization
This project focuses on creating a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as population data segmented by different attributes. The visualization is performed using Excel for ease of use and accessibility.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this visualization comes from the World Bank's Total Population Indicator.

Source: World Bank Population Data
Description: This dataset contains population data for different countries over various years. You can explore and filter the data by year or country to fit your visualization needs.

# Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to:

1. Create a bar chart or histogram to understand the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.
2. Visualize the distribution of population across countries or over time.
3. Gain insights into trends, such as population growth patterns.

# Tools Used
Microsoft Excel: Used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

# Steps to Reproduce

1. Download the Dataset: Visit the World Bank Population Indicator page using the link above.
2. Download the dataset in CSV or Excel format.

# Data Cleaning and Preparation:

1. Open the dataset in Excel.
2. Filter or extract the relevant data columns (e.g., country names, years, population).
3. Handle missing values (e.g., remove or replace them as needed).

# Creating the Visualization:

* Select the relevant data range.
* Go to the Insert tab in Excel.
* Choose Bar Chart or Histogram under Chart options.
* Customize the chart (e.g., add titles, labels, colors).

# Analysis:

Used the chart to identify key trends or patterns in the data (e.g., countries with the highest/lowest population).

# Example Visualizations
* Bar Chart: Displaying total population per country for a specific year.
* Histogram: Showing the frequency distribution of population sizes across countries.

# Conclusion
This project helps visualize population distribution trends using simple Excel tools. By plotting the data, we can quickly identify population patterns and understand the dynamics across different countries and time periods.


# Future Improvements
We can perform similar analysis in Python or R for advanced visualizations.
Using Power BI or Tableau for interactive dashboards.
