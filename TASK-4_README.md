# Sentiment Analysis and Visualization of Social Media Data  

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing **sentiment patterns** in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics or brands. Using the **Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis Dataset** from Kaggle, the goal is to extract meaningful insights into how people express their views.

## Dataset  
- **Source**: [Kaggle Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis)  
- **Description**: The dataset contains tweets, along with corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral), and associated entities (e.g., people, organizations, or products).  
- **Key Columns**:  
  - **Tweet**: The text of the tweet.  
  - **Entity**: The target entity (e.g., brand or product).  
  - **Sentiment**: Sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral).

## Project Objectives  
The main objectives of this project are:  
1. **Preprocess the dataset** to clean tweets and handle noise (e.g., remove hashtags, mentions, and links).  
2. **Analyze sentiment patterns** across entities to identify public opinion and attitude shifts.  
3. **Visualize the distribution** of sentiment labels and compare sentiments across different entities.  
4. **Gain insights** to inform brand strategies based on the identified sentiment trends.

## Tools Used  
- **Python**: Primary programming language.  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data preprocessing and manipulation.  
  - `nltk` and `textblob` for text cleaning and sentiment analysis.  
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.  
  - `wordcloud` for generating word clouds from tweets.

## Procedure
1. **Download the Dataset**:  
   - Visit the Kaggle dataset page from the link above.  
   - Download the dataset in **CSV** format.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Clean the tweet text by removing special characters, URLs, and mentions.  
   - Tokenize text and apply **stopword removal**.  
   - Handle any missing or duplicate entries.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:  
   - Use the **pre-labeled sentiments** or apply sentiment analysis using libraries like `TextBlob` or `VADER`.  
   - Analyze how sentiments vary across different entities.

4. **Visualization**:  
   - Plot the **distribution of sentiment labels** using bar charts or pie charts.  
   - Compare sentiment patterns for different entities using grouped bar plots.  
   - Create **word clouds** for positive and negative tweets to identify frequently used words.

5. **Insight Extraction**:  
   - Identify trends, such as which entities receive the most positive or negative mentions.  
   - Examine shifts in sentiment over time if the dataset includes timestamps.

## Example Insights  
- **Brand Sentiment**: Determine which brands have the highest positive or negative sentiment on Twitter.  
- **Public Opinion**: Identify frequent issues or topics associated with negative sentiment.  
- **Trending Words**: Extract words frequently used in positive and negative tweets to understand public concerns or praises.

## Conclusion  
This project demonstrates the power of sentiment analysis in uncovering public opinion patterns from social media data. The insights derived can help brands refine their strategies and respond to customer feedback more effectively.

---

## Future Improvements  
- Apply **machine learning models** (e.g., Logistic Regression or BERT) for more advanced sentiment classification.  
- Perform **topic modeling** to uncover underlying themes in tweets.  
- Develop a **dashboard** to monitor real-time sentiment trends.
