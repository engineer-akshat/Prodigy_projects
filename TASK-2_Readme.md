# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

This project focuses on performing **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to uncover relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

---

## Dataset  
The dataset used for this analysis is the **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle.

- **Source:** [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)  
- **Description:** This dataset contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including features such as passenger class, age, sex, fare, and whether they survived the disaster.

---

## Project Objectives  
The goals of this project are to:  
1. Clean the dataset to handle missing values, incorrect data types, and irrelevant features.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and relationships between variables.
3. Visualize the data to identify trends, such as survival rates by class, age distribution, and the impact of gender on survival.

---

## Tools Used  
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and cleaning.
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.

## Procedure 
1. **Download the Dataset**:  
   - Access the Titanic dataset from the Kaggle link provided above and download the CSV files.

2. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Identify and handle missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).
   - Convert data types where necessary (e.g., categorical variables).
   - Drop any irrelevant features that do not contribute to the analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Analyze the data to explore relationships between variables:
     - Compare survival rates by passenger class, gender, and age.
     - Examine the distribution of fares and how they relate to survival.
     - Visualize the data to uncover any noticeable patterns or trends.

4. **Data Visualization**:  
   - Use graphs and charts (e.g., bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots) to visualize the findings from the analysis.

---

## Example Insights  
- Analysis of survival rates based on passenger class and gender.
- Age distribution of passengers and its impact on survival.
- Correlation between fare and survival rates.

---

## Conclusion  
This project demonstrates the importance of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis in understanding datasets. By applying EDA techniques, we can reveal valuable insights into the factors that influenced survival on the Titanic.

---

## Future Improvements  
- Implement predictive modeling to forecast survival based on passenger characteristics.
- Explore other datasets for comparative analysis.
